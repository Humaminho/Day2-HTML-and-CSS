        <h1><strong>TOP 5 HXH NEN ABILITIES</strong></h1>
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p> Here's my top 5 list of Nen abilities showcased in the HxH anime series <em>(2011)</em>, based on brute power, versatility, and nen mastery</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3> <strong>Number 5: Hisoka's Bungee Gum:</strong></h3></li>

                <h4>Nen user: Hisoka Morow</h4>
                <h4>Nen ability: Bungee Gum</h4>
                <p>Hisoka can alter his aura's consistency into an incredibly sticky and elastic substance, this ability allows him to make his aura sticky and elastic
                    "have the properties of both rubber AND gum". Hisoka can alter his aura's consistency into an incredibly sticky and elastic substance. 
                    Bungee Gum technique. A flexible, rubbery aura is a powerful tool, <strong>but the ability to attach this aura to people and objects</strong>
                     makes Hisoka a true force to be reckoned with. </p>
                     <p> I placed him in this list not because of it's destructive power, but for its crazy versatility and Hisoka's high mastery of this simple but 
                        highly effective nen ability wich he showcased in his many battles in the anime.
                     </p>

                     <h4>Nen user: Zeno Zoldyck</h4>
                     <h4>Nen ability: Dragon Head</h4>
                     <p>One of the srongest Nen abilities showed in the chimera arc, with overwhelmingly destructive power, Zeno's Dragon Head
                        Zeno can transmute his aura into a tangible extension of the body in the form of a dragon,which he then hurls at the opponent as a straight shot.
                        This ability is often used in conjunction with Emission, allowing Zeno to shoot the dragon as a projectile or use it as a means of transportation.
                        Dragon Head can also serve as a basis for other Nen abilities, such as <strong>Dragon Lance</strong> and <strong>Dragon Dive</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition to its crazy power Zeno showcases an amazing mastery in emission wich is expected from the second oldest Zoldyck family member,
                            that's why i think <strong>Dragon Head</strong> definitely deserves a place in this list.
                        </p>
